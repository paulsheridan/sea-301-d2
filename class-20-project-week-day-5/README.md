# Class 20 -  Project Week: Milestone 5
## Presentation Day

* Be mindful of the presentation schedule, when your team presents, and go see as many other presentations as you can.
 * At 12:30 pm, Fri Jan 29, 2016 (the final day of the course), all teams are to meet in the Easy classroom. One by one, each team will present their projects to the whole class.
 * Every team member should make meaningful contributions to the presentation.
 * Plan for a **10-minute** presentation, followed by up to 5 minutes for questions.
 * Have one team member track the time and keep the presentation moving forward.
 * Explain your project's problem domain, User Stories, and your team's solution.
 * Describe challenges that came up during project week and how your team overcame them.

## Canvas Submission
In Canvas, find the "Final Project Main Assignment" and make your submission *after* your team's final presentation:
 * Share links to commits or Pull Requests that demonstrate your contributions, and describe your individual contributions to the team and the project.
 * What are you most proud of?
 * What would have done differently?
 * What lessons did you learn from this experience?

## Grade
Your grade is the sum of the following three grades:
* Your individual contributions [60 pts]
* Your project's technical merit [35 pts]
* Your team's final presentation [5 pts]

The team portion of your grade is the grade for your project's technical merit. Every member of your team will receive the same number of points.

The individual portion of your grade is based on your individual contributions and your comments during your team's final presentation.

* Each member is graded individually based on meaningful contributions in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. Contributions must be tracked using git commits. Be sure your **links to commits and Pull Requests** demonstrate your contributions.
* Your individual grade depends on the following criteria:
 * [40 pts] Javascript contributions
 * [5 pts] HTML code
 * [5 pts] CSS code
 * [2 pts] extra credit for each of the following items:
  * &nbsp; &nbsp; CSS keyframe animations
  * &nbsp; &nbsp; SVG graphics manipulation using Javascript or CSS
  * &nbsp; &nbsp; Third party animation libraries such as jQuery mobile or velocity.js
 * [8 pts] Answers to questions/instructions in this assignment. Submit links to commits and pull requests that demonstrate your contributions. Activities tracked by the links must show that you committed work every day of the week. Describe each link in terms of the tasks you accomplished.

* Your project's technical merit is graded based on the following criteria:
 * **Obvious MVC/REST architecture**
    * Single-page application; all app "pages" have bookmark-able routes in the URL
    * Clearly defined Resources in the app
    * Resource data is persisted by a **database** (the app saves and retrieves at least some of the persistent data using **SQL commands**)
    * Resources have well-factored and isolated M, V, C components
    * URLs use conventional REST design
 * **Proper use of HTML**
    * Clear, readable, efficient structure
    * Uses semantic markup whenever possible
    * Contains no unnecessary code.
 * **Proper use of CSS**
    * Clear, readable, efficient styles
    * Responsive layout on various screen sizes such as mobile in landscape and portrait mode, and on tablets/laptops
    * Well-organized file structure. Consider using SMACSS principals.
    * Contains no unnecessary code.
 * **Proper use of JavaScript**
    * Clear, readable, efficient code
    * Uses domain models to encapsulate data and behavior (OOP)
    * Responds to user events
    * Leverages AJAX appropriately in at least one case
    * Uses AJAX to load dynamic data, caches the data locally, and uses a cache-validation scheme on page reload.
    * Integrates 3rd party libraries (e.g., jQuery) consistently. Excluding jQuery and pages.js, uses at least one other 3rd party Javascript library
    * Contains no unnecessary or commented-out code
 * **Generally useful and functional**
    * Works as expected with no bugs
    * Has at least three interlinked "pages" with clear navigation between the pages.
    * Has at least two pages that accept and process user input
    * Application state persists between page loads.
    * Deployed live on the Internet. Suggestions: heroku, surge.sh, or your own web hosting service.
    * **Include a short video clip** (10 to 20 seconds in duration) that contains audio and video content. The video must be related to your web app, or introduces your team. Video playback controls must be enabled. Incorporate video using one of the following options:
     * &nbsp; &nbsp; For video you found online, use the &lt;video&gt; element.
     * &nbsp; &nbsp; For video that you created and uploaded to a 3rd party video server such as YouTube, use &lt;iframe&gt;, then in your Canvas submission for this assignment, describe how your created and uploaded the video.
     * &nbsp; &nbsp; Animate your own video or animation inside &lt;canvas&gt;.
     * Extra credit [+2 pts]: Use Javascript to show/hide closed captions in the video, and describe in your comments the difference between closed captions and subtitles.
    * Avoids race condition bugs by using appropriate callback design. Alternatives to chained callbacks are synchronization mechanisms (see extra credit item, next).
    * [+5 pts. E.C.] Uses jQuery deferred objects or Javascript Promises to avoid race conditions related to async events such as page load, client-side routing, AJAX responses, user input events, and timers.

## Congratulations!
Thanks for all your hard work through this course! We can't wait to see where you go with your new super powers. :)
